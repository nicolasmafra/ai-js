## Parameters

- Total robots: Quantity of AI robots in each generation. 1000 is a good value in computers, 100 in mobile.
- Death percent: Amount of robots discarded in each generation (relative to total robots). They will be replaced.
- Percent of live "champions": Amount of robot that will replicate (relative to not discarded robots).
- Maximum quantity of mutations: number of iterations of a single neural network weight mutation.
